    /*a static variable is a variable that belongs to the class, rather than to any specific instance (object) of that class.
     This means that a static variable is shared among all instances of the class.

    Hereâ€™s a simple explanation:

    1.Static means that the variable is tied to the class itself, not to individual objects.
    2.Every object created from the class shares the same static variable.
    3.Static variables are initialized only once, and they exist for the duration of the program.
    4.In other class if we want to call the static variable then we need to use the classname.variable.
      No need to create a object of that class.
